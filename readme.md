Mited
=====================================

Mited (shortened 見るて) is an Open Source image gesture recognizing service.

This service uses convolutional neural networks to recognize gestures and evaluate
pivot points, everything is running fully locally on your machine.

This service can be retrained on other data than hand gestures, but if you do so
please bear in mind that this service is primarily intended to recognize hand gestures.

- Custom gestures
- Gesture type recognition
- Point mapping for each gesture
- Does not block camera -> camera multiplexing
